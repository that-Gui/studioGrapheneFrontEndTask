# studioGrapheneFrontEndTask

I have completed this SPA as part of the Studio Graphene recruitment process and would like to say that it was a great opportunity to learn and test myself.

All sizes/units were implemented with 2560X1440 viewport in mind but also a few to catter to viewport 1920X1080, meaning this SPA is not fully responsive and i did not add break points.

#Known bugs
- missing footer social icons
- side pagination is buggy and 01 only works on page reload
- menu section reverse animations are not functioning
- menu section error `Each child in a list should have a unique "key"`
